				<h2>Dianne Feinstein, longest-serving female US senator in history, dies at 90</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p><span>Washington(CNN)—</span>Dianne Feinstein, whose three decades in the Senate made her the longest-serving female US senator in history, has died following months of declining health. She was 90.</p>
					<p>Feinstein’s death, confirmed to CNN by a source familiar, will hand California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom the power to appoint a lawmaker to serve out the rest of Feinstein’s term, keeping the Democratic majority in the chamber through early January 2025. In March 2021, Newsom <span>publicly said</span> he had a list of “multiple” replacements and pledged to appoint a Black woman if Feinstein, a Democrat, were to retire.</p>
				</div>
				<h2>San Francisco native and leader</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Feinstein was <span>born in San Francisco in 1933</span> and graduated from Stanford University in 1955. After serving as a San Francisco County supervisor, Feinstein became the city’s mayor in 1978 in the wake of the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay politician from California to be elected to office.</p>
					<p>Feinstein rarely talked about the day when Moscone and Milk were shot but she opened up about the tragic events <span>in a 2017 interview</span> with CNN’s Dana Bash.</p>

					<h3>Read the letter here.</h3>
					<p>“In imprisoning a man who embodies Hong Kong’s rise, authorities in the city are showing the world they no longer tolerate the very things that once made it so great: free speech, the rule of law and a love for liberty,” Sebastien Lai, Jimmy’s son, <span>wrote</span> in a New York Times guest essay on Thursday.</p>
